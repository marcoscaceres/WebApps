        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>As Web browsers and the Web engine components that power them become
          ubiquitous across a range of operating systems and devices, developers
          are increasingly using Web technologies to build applications and are
          relying on Web engines as application runtime environments. Examples
          of applications now commonly built using Web technologies include
          reservation systems, online shopping / auction sites, games,
          multimedia applications, maps, enterprise-specific applications,
          interactive design applications, and <abbr title="Personal Information Management">PIM</abbr>
          (email, calendar, etc) systems. </p>
        <p>The target environments for the Web Applications Working Group's
          deliverables include browsers on desktop, mobile devices such as
          phones and tablets, televisions, and other devices, as well as
          non-browser environments that make use of Web technologies. The group
          seeks to promote universal access to Web applications across a wide
          range of devices and among a diversity of users, including users with
          particular accessibility needs. The APIs must provide generic and
          consistent interoperability and integration among all target formats,
          such HTML, XHTML, and SVG. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="scope">
        <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
        <p>This charter extends the third <a title="Web Applications Working Group Charter"
            href="http://www.w3.org/2012/webapps/charter/Overview.html">Web
            Applications Working Group Charter</a> to produce deliverables
          necessary for the evolving Web application market, and continue work
          already in progress.</p>
        <p>The scope of the Web Applications Working Group covers the
          technologies related to developing client-side applications on the
          Web, including both markup vocabularies for describing and controlling
          client-side application behavior and programming interfaces for
          client-side development. </p>
        <p>Additionally, server-side APIs for support of client-side
          functionality may be defined as needed.</p>
        <p>Web Applications Working Group specifications are expected to be
          applicable to an array of target formats â€” including HTML, XHTML, SVG,
          DAISY, MathML, SMIL, and other DOM-related technology. Although the
          primary focus will be handling of content deployed over the Web, the
          deliverables of the Web Applications Working Group should take into
          consideration uses of Web technologies for other purposes, such as
          building user interfaces on devices.</p>
        <p>The Web Applications Working Group should adopt, refine and when
          needed, extend, existing practices where possible. The Working Group
          should also take into account the fact that some deliverables will
          most likely be tied to widely deployed platforms. It is reasonable for
          the Working Group to deliver APIs optimized for particular languages,
          such as ECMAScript. Interfaces for other languages such as Java,
          Python, C# and Ruby, may be developed in cooperation with the
          organizations responsible for those languages.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the Web Applications Working Group deliverables must
          address issues of <strong><em>accessibility</em></strong>, <strong><em>internationalization</em></strong>,
          <strong><em>mobility</em></strong>, <strong><em>security</em></strong>,
          and <strong><em>privacy</em></strong>.</p>
        <p>Testing plays an important role in improving the current state of Web
          applications. Comprehensive test suites will be developed for each
          specification to ensure interoperability, and the group will assist in
          the production of interoperability reports. The group will also
          maintain errata as required for the continued relevance and usefulness
          of the specifications it produces.</p>
        <p>Members of the Web Application Working Group should review other
          working groups' deliverables that are identified as being relevant to
          Web Applications Working Group mission. </p>
        <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
        <p>In order to advance to Proposed Recommendation, each specification is
          expected to have at least two independent implementations of each
          feature defined in the specification. </p>
      </div>

        <h4>3.1.2 Abandoned work</h4>
        <p>Some deliverables from the previous charter will no longer be worked
          as documented in the group's 
	  <a href="http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/wiki/PubStatus#Specs_NO_Longer_Active">non-active specs</a> wiki.</p>
        
        <h4 id="others">3.1.2. Other Specifications</h4>
        <p>The market for applications of Web technologies continues to evolve
          quickly. Therefore, in addition to the specifications described in
          this charter, the Web Applications Working Group may take on
          additional specifications necessary to enable the creation of Web
          applications to meet the needs of the market as it evolves.</p>
        <p>Specifically, because of the close relationship of the WebApps WG and
          the HTML WG in terms of participants, market, and community, the
          WebApps WG may opt to take on a limited number of specifications which
          were initially part of the HTML5 specification that have been split
          off for more general use with other languages. Consistent with W3C
          process, an <a title="World Wide Web Consortium Process Document" href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/process.html#ReviewAppeal">Advisory
            Committee Review</a> will evaluate whether the additional
          deliverable should be added to the WebApps WG charter. The expectation
          is that if the review is successful, Working Group participants will
          not be required to re-join the Working Group. For any work transferred
          to the WebApps WG, the first draft published in the WebApps WG is
          considered the first public Working Draft for application of the <a title="W3C Patent Policy"
            href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/#sec-Obligations">Patent
            Policy exclusion rules</a>.</p>
        <p>Other specification proposals may be identified by new submissions
          from Members, or by market research. These deliverables will require
          rechartering the Working Group.</p>
        <p>For all new deliverables, the WebApps WG should develop an associated
          requirements section or document that identifies demonstrable use
          cases.</p>
        <h3>Other Deliverables</h3>
        <p>Other non-normative documents may be created such as:</p>
        <div id="ig-other-deliverables">
          <ul>
            <li>Test suites for each specification</li>
            <li>Primers for each specification</li>
            <li>Requirements document for new specifications</li>
            <li>Non-normative schemas for language formats</li>
            <li>Non-normative group notes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>A comprehensive test suite for all features of a specification is
            necessary to ensure the specification's robustness, consistency, and
            implementability, and to promote interoperability between User
            Agents. Therefore, each specification must have a companion test
            suite, which should be completed by the end of the Last Call phase,
            and must be completed, with an implementation report, before
            transition from Candidate Recommendation to Proposed Recommendation.
            Additional tests may be added to the test suite at any stage of the
            Recommendation track, and the maintenance of a implementation report
            is encouraged. </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Schedule</h3>
        <p>The working group maintains a page with its <a href="http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/wiki/PubStatus">schedule
            expectations</a> for deliverables. 
      </div>

      <div class="dependencies">
        <h2 id="coordination">Dependencies and Liaisons</h2>
        <h3>Dependencies</h3>
        <p>A number of specifications depend on the WebIDL specification, which
          is therefore a very high priority for the Working Group. </p>
        <p>Several specifications have a dependency on the HTML 5 specification.
        </p>
        <p>The Web Sockets specification has an effective dependency on the
          protocol defined by the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/dyn/wg/charter/hybi-charter.html">IETF's
            HyBi Working Group</a>. </p>
        <p>The specifications of several other groups, such as <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/">HTML</a>
          and <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG"> SVG</a>, depend upon
          particular Web Applications Working Group specifications.
          Where possible, additional dependencies will be
          avoided to prevent the disruption of dependent deliverables. </p>
        <h3>Liaisons</h3>
        <p>The Web Applications Working Group expects to maintain contacts with
          at least the following groups and Activities within W3C (in

          <dl>
            <dt><a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC39.htm" id="tc39">ECMA
                Technical Committee 39 (TC39)</a></dt>
            <dd>This is the group responsible for ECMAScript standardization,
              and related ECMAScript features like E4X. As the Web Applications
              Working Group will be developing ECMAScript APIs, it should

            <dd>The IETF is responsible for defining robust and secure protocols
              for Internet functionality. A close relationship with the IETF
              HTTP group is crucial to ensuring the good design, deployment, and
              success of protocol-based APIs such as CORS and Web Sockets. This
              Working Group will rely upon review and parallel progress of
              associated specifications, and will keep pace with the IETF's HTTP
              and <a href="http://www.ietf.org/dyn/wg/charter/hybi-charter.html">HyBi</a>
              groups' work, conditional upon steady progress. The working group
              may well also liaise with the IETFs Web Security Working Group,
              either directly or through its liaison with the W3C's Web

        <h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>
        <p>As explained in the W3C Process Document (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section
            3.3</a>), this group will seek to make decisions when there is
          consensus and with due process. The expectation is that typically, an
          editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then
          refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers,
          and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus
          is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views
          presented, the Chairs should put a question out for voting within the
          group (allowing for remote asynchronous participation -- using, for
          example, email and/or web-based survey techniques) and record a
          decision, along with any objections. The matter should then be
          considered resolved unless and until new information becomes
          available.</p>
        <p>Any resolution taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference is
          to be considered provisional until 10 working days after the
          publication of the resolution in draft minutes sent to the working
          groups mailing list. If no objections are raised on the mailing list
          within that time, the resolution will be considered to have consensus
          as a resolution of the Working Group. </p>
        <p>This charter is written in accordance with <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">Section
